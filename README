A skeleton Maven project that includes Cuke4Duke for accpetance tests.

Unlike the examples that ship with Cuke4Duke this example has the acceptance 
tests in a seperate module.

Note: you will need to ensure that the Cucumber version specified in 
acceptance/pom.xml matches the lastest version of Cucumber.

Before running for the first time you will need to run:

mvn -Dcucumber.installGems=true cuke4duke:features

from the acceptance directroy in order to install the required gems
